1. No rule to make target libchromium_net.so (?) required by libstagefright (?)

Problem: Dependency on chromium has not been removed properly. Issue crops up because of some changes that we have made
Corrective action: Replace $(HTTP) with "android" (no quotes) in frameworks/base/media/libstagefright/Android.mk

2. target thumb C: libwebrtc_ns <= external/webrtc/src/modules/audio_processing/ns/main/source/nsx_core.c

make: *** [out/target/product/u8150/obj/STATIC_LIBRARIES/libwebrtc_ns_intermediates/nsx_core.o] Error 1

Problem: webrtc does not work for ARM processors < v7. Ideos has ARMv6.
Corrective action: Use a different webrtc folder (we need to put this up in github).
Refer to: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1501114&page=3

3. make: *** No rule to make target `packages/wallpapers/LivePicker/android.software.live_wallpaper.xml', needed by `out/target/product/u8150/system/etc/permissions/android.software.live_wallpaper.xml'.  Stop.

Problem: some wallpapers dependency. 
Comment the line containing "android.software.live_wallpaper.xml" in vendor/huawei/u8150/u8150-vendor.mk

4. make: *** No rule to make target `development/data/etc/apns-conf_sdk.xml', needed by `out/target/product/u8150/system/etc/apns-conf.xml'.  Stop.

Problem: development folder is not there - it is not there for galaxy-s2 also.
Correction: Comment it out! Hash the lines in build/core/main.mk and in build/target/product/full_base_telephony.mk which includes "apns-conf". Don't comment out the PRODUCT_COPY_FILES variable altogether. Just comment out the assigned part.

5. make: *** [out/host/linux-x86/obj/STATIC_LIBRARIES/libgtest_host_intermediates/gtest-all.o] Error 1

Problem: 64-bit host is required for compilation. 
Correction: Add #include <cstddef> to external/gtest/include/gtest/internal/gtest_param_util.h

6. hardware/qcom/display/libcopybit/copybit.cpp:133: error: 'MDP_Y_CBCR_H2V2_ADRENO' was not declared in this scope

Solution: In B2G/hardware/qcom/display/libcopybit/copybit.cpp, change <linux/msm_mdp.h> to "msm_mdp.h", and copy msm_mdp.h from here: 
https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CFAQFjAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.codeaurora.org%2Fgit%2Fprojects%2Fqrd-gb-dsds-7225%2Frepository%2Frevisions%2Fb97d35a9fe38c93178837dcea5d88d0fb28e9ba7%2Fraw%2Fkernel%2Finclude%2Flinux%2Fmsm_mdp.h&ei=YbXyT6zaC4XkrAfPl_3ACQ&usg=AFQjCNHULCj4nPDqYOMwOE0ZLv0blbLDrA&sig2=92s0mVDvebuCwCI9QWrvMg&cad=rja
Add "MDP_Y_CBCR_H2V2_ADRENO," to the enum below "MDP_Y_CRCB_H2V2,"

7. error: 'ASHMEM_CACHE_FLUSH_RANGE' was not declared in this scope

Solution: Take ashmem.h from here:

and place it in B2G/hardware/qcom/display/libgralloc/ directory.
In B2G/hardware/qcom/display/libgralloc/ashmemalloc.cpp, replace <linux/ashmem.h> with "ashmem.h".

10. error: linux/genlock.h: no such file or directory
error: linux/msm_rotator.h: no such file or directory
error: conflicting declaration 'HWC_LAYER_NOT_UPDATING'
...
and therefore, a whole lot more.

Add genlock.h to bionic/libc/kernel/common/linux.
In it, put this:
http://code.google.com/p/bricked/source/browse/include/linux/genlock.h?spec=svn.tenderloin.1d64c5abd8860ffdee23999fe471350d448e039b&repo=tenderloin&name=ics-exp&r=1d64c5abd8860ffdee23999fe471350d448e039b

Add a hardware/qcom/display/liboverlay/msm_rotator.h with this content:
https://www.codeaurora.org/git/projects/qrd7225-ds-froyo/repository/revisions/cf2880e06f7f20cb3f10f8ee386924e4d0fe6fc9/entry/bionic/libc/kernel/common/linux/msm_rotator.h
and change the header file overlayLib.h accordingly (<linux/msm_rotator.h> => "msm_rotator.h")

Comment out HWC_LAYER_NOT_UPDATING definition in hardware/qcom/display/libqcomui/qcom_ui.h to fix the conflicting definitions issue.

11. [TODO] Fix genalloc for the kernel from here: https://github.com/CyanogenMod/lge-kernel-msm7x27/commit/213b2658a2cf1a5ea0d971b610f67d36a8a96c73

12. 'struct framebuffer_device_t' has no member named 'perform'
