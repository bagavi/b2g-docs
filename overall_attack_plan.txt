1. Port B2G to Galaxy S II. Serves as a reference base.
	Issues:
	1.1 Mic is not working
	1.2 Camera is not working
	1.3 UI is not fully functional -> although this seems to be due
		to incomplete development.

2. Install Android on the Beagle board. 
	2.1 Find and compile kernel for the beagleboard -> this has 
		been done.
	2.2 If possible, find android code that is specific to the 
		beagleboard. -> this has been done.
	2.3 Get connectors for the beagleboard. -> this is under way.
	2.4 Check out code for the USB driver, see if it works, how it 
		works, etc. If not, make it work.
	2.5 Take note of libraries present in this version of android. 
		This will be used later while modifying files.
	2.6 Configure WiFi through USB (?)

3. Port B2G to the beagle board.
	3.1 Modify relevant files in the B2G code:
		3.1.1 config.sh
			Need to create a new case statement to include the board
		3.1.2 extract-files.sh
			Need to modify the library and media files
		3.1.3 flash.sh
			Need to modify the whole file. SD card can be directly 
			mounted and B2G can be put on the SD card.
	3.2 Compile and debug => This will probably take the longest
		amount of time.
	3.3 "Flash" the SD card after mounting it.

4. Port B2G to Huawei Ideos U8150.
	4.1 Find rooting and flashing software for the ideos.
		For this, we can use z4root (for rooting). Methods for 
		flashing are also available on xda forums.
	4.2 Scout the android code present in Ideos to determine 
		library files, etc. required to write extract-files.sh
	4.3 Modify the necessary files in the B2G code.
	4.4 Compile and debug => again, this will take the most time.
	4.5 Get the USB driver to work.
	4.6 Get the WiFi driver to work.
	4.7 Get the camera to work.
	4.8 Get telephony to work.
