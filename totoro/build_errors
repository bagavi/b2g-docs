1. Target architecture (ARMv6-vfp) not found.
The build/core/combo/arch/arm folder contains a bunch of folders that tell you which architectures are supported. We need to add a new makefile in this folder for armv6-vfp. This makefile can be got from https://github.com/cyanogenmod/android_build/core/combo/arch/arm/armv6-vfp.mk

2. build/core/base_rules.mk:170: *** system/extras/ext4_utils: MODULE.TARGET.EXECUTABLES.setup_fs already defined by device/samsung/totoro.  Stop.

Problem: setup_fs is being compiled from both system/extras/ext4_utils as well as from device/samsung/totoro. Can only be built from one place. 
Correction: Replace the following lines:
    LOCAL_SRC_FILES := setup_fs.c
    LOCAL_MODULE := setup_fs
with the following lines:
    # LOCAL_SRC_FILES := setup_fs.c
    # LOCAL_MODULE := setup_fs
    LOCAL_SRC_FILES := dummy.c
    LOCAL_MODULE := dummy
and create a "dummy.c" file in the same directory:
    dummy.c:
        /* Dummy file to remove the setup_fs duplicate */
        #include <stdio.h>
        void dummy(void)
        {
            int dummy=0;
        }

3. hardware/libhardware_legacy/wifi/wifi.c:26:36: error: libwpa_client/wpa_ctrl.h: No such file or directory
Alternately: No rule to make target libwpa_client.so needed by libhardware_legacy.so

Problem: We have wpa_supplicant version 8, whereas wpa_supplicant version 6 is required. Check device/samsung/totoro/BoardConfig.mk to figure out wpa_supplicant version number supported by your device.
Correction: Change wpa_supplicant_8 to wpa_supplicant_6 in manifest file.

4. make: *** No rule to make target `packages/wallpapers/LivePicker/android.software.live_wallpaper.xml', needed by `out/target/product/totoro/system/etc/permissions/android.software.live_wallpaper.xml'.  Stop.

Problem: some wallpapers dependency. 
Correction: Since this has low importance, we can just comment it away.
Comment the line containing "android.software.live_wallpaper.xml" in vendor/samsung/totoro/totoro-vendor.mk and in device/samsung/totoro/full_totoro.mk

Problem: armv6-vfp compatibility issue
